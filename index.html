        <h2>Introduction to the Trading Strategy</h2>
        <p>Let's start by discussing some fundamental concepts crucial to understanding this strategy. The first concept is <strong>trend</strong>, which refers to a market movement in a consistent direction, either upwards or downwards. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have <strong>reversal</strong>, which signifies a change in the direction of the trend. The market's behavior can generally be broken down into trends and reversals, which, metaphorically speaking, are like the building blocks of the market, similar to Lego pieces that combine in various configurations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Proposition 1: Continuum of Trends and Reversals</h2>
        <p><strong>Trends</strong> are characterized by movements in a straight line, either up or down. <strong>Reversals</strong> typically form V-shaped patterns, where the first leg can be longer or shorter than the second. These patterns and movements exist on a continuum, meaning there isn't a strict boundary separating trends from reversals; rather, they blend into each other.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Proposition 2: Different Timeframes Show Different Things</h2>
        <p>Different timeframes reveal different aspects of the market. For instance, the daily timeframe will show a different picture compared to the one-minute timeframe. However, as timeframes become more similar (e.g., the daily vs. the 12-hour or the one-minute vs. the three-minute), their patterns and behaviors also become more alike.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Proposition 3: An Indicator for Market Sentiment</h2>
        <p>There exists an indicator capable of gauging market sentiment on a scale from -100 (most bearish) to +100 (most bullish). This indicator will be explained in detail later, but for now, it's important to understand that the indicator is crucial in defining and analyzing trends and reversals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Defining Trends and Reversals</h2>
        <p>With the basic propositions in place, let's define what a <strong>trend</strong> and a <strong>reversal</strong> are in this context:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trend:</strong> A trend occurs when the bullishness of the lower timeframe equals that of the higher timeframe, and the average of both is greater than zero for bullish trends and less than zero for bearish trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Reversal:</strong> A reversal occurs when the lower timeframe's bullishness is greater than the higher timeframe's, and the average is equal to or near zero for bullish reversals. Conversely, for bearish reversals, the lower timeframe's bullishness is less than the higher timeframe's, with the average being equal to or near zero.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Introducing the Concept of Value</h2>
        <p>Neither pure trend-following nor pure reversal strategies are sustainable. Trend-following strategies tend to have low win rates but favorable risk-to-reward ratios, while reversal strategies have high win rates but poor risk-to-reward ratios. There needs to be a middle ground, which I call <strong>value</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Value</strong> is defined as a state where the market exhibits characteristics of both a trend and a reversal. This concept is crucial because it represents areas where both the lower and higher timeframes exhibit complementary behaviors, creating opportunities for trades that combine elements of both trends and reversals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Value Quadrants</h2>
        <p>In this strategy, we consider a Cartesian plane where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>x-axis</strong> represents the difference between the lower and higher timeframes (LT - HT).</li>
            <li>The <strong>y-axis</strong> represents the average of the lower and higher timeframes (LT + HT)/2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Value areas</strong> are those where both the average and the difference have the same sign (both positive or both negative). The optimal trading areas are located in these value quadrants.</p>
        <p>Conversely, the least optimal areas to trade are along the <strong>devalue axis</strong>—the axis perpendicular to the value axis—where the difference and the average have opposite signs.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>The Universal Indicator (Candle Bias Oscillator)</h2>
        <p>The core of this strategy is the <strong>CBO indicator</strong>, which gauges market sentiment by analyzing candle structures. The indicator works by assessing the ratio between the upper wick and the lower wick, as well as the ratio between the body and the entire candle. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Body Bias:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the open is greater than the close, the market is bearish, and the ratio is calculated as (close - open) / (high - low).</li>
                    <li>If the close is greater than the open, the market is bullish, and the ratio is calculated as (open - close) / (high - low).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wick Bias:</strong> This is determined by comparing the upper and lower wicks:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the upper wick is longer than the lower wick, the wick bias is calculated as (lower wick length - upper wick length) / (upper wick length + lower wick length), which will give a negative value.</li>
                    <li>If the lower wick is longer than the upper wick, the wick bias is calculated as (upper wick length - lower wick length) / (upper wick length + lower wick length), which will give a positive value.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The average of the body bias and wick bias provides a comprehensive overview of the market's sentiment.</p>
        <p><strong>Why the CBO Indicator Is Best Suited to This Strategy:</strong><br>The CBO indicator is particularly well-suited for this strategy because it can output vastly different ratings depending on the timeframe. This is due to the fact that candles across different timeframes can have very different wick or body biases, making the CBO indicator's ability to adapt to these differences invaluable for accurate market sentiment analysis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Applying the Trigonometric Function</h2>
        <p>The final piece of the puzzle involves using trigonometry to evaluate the indicator's output. The <strong>cosine of the arctangent</strong> of the difference (LT - HT) and the average [(LT + HT)/2] minus π/4 prioritizes the value axis, outputting +100% when within the value axis and -100% outside it.</p>
        <p>By applying this trigonometric function, you can determine the market's bias (bullish or bearish) based on the location of the point on the Cartesian plane. This bias, once calculated, can be multiplied by the <strong>ATR (Average True Range)</strong> to scale the forecast by volatility, making the predictions more reliable and adaptive to different timeframes.</p>
